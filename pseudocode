STRETCH GOALS
COMPUTER ATTACK
If the computer misses a white pin is places on that point and next turn retruns to random selection minus the grid with a pin in it.
If the computer hits a ship the computer choses the cells nextdoor, once two are hit the computer moves in a line at the end of the line the computer reverses until a miss.
Once a miss move back to random.

USER Grid
User to drag and drop ships.
Ships have to be able to rotate.
Ships to only be able to be placed within the grid.
Ships to not overlap ontop of each other.

Section for chosing ship coords

1. Start with list of all of the cells
2. chose a direction
3. remove from the list of valid cells any cell that is invalid for direction e.g. too close to right for carrier
   if ship direction is horizontal, max width is width minus ship length
   if ship direction is verticle, max height is width minus ship length.
4. remove from list of cells any cell that is invalid because of existing ships
5. pick one of the remaining valid cells at random
6. from shipStart create whole ship.
